7 In 1837 there were two methods of sending a message along a telegraph line. Wheatstone and Cook’s system required two wires and operators at each end; Samuel Morse’s invention was the preferred technology because it required only a single wire. Messages could be sent at about 35 words per minute using the Morse code, and up to 45 words per minute using Wheatstone and Cook’s apparatus

14 Minimum charges for ten-word telegrams in 1868 ranged from a penny a word between nearby stations to eight pence a word for longer routes. A universal rate of one shilling for ten words was adopted in the 1870s. In 1896, sixpence telegrams were adopted to encourage traffic, but by 1915 the postmaster general was speaking publicly of a loss of tuppence on every telegram handled, and the basic rate was increased to eight pence that year and to one shilling in 1920. Charges continued to fluctuate to meet rising costs without noticeable impacting traffic growth. Three and a half million inland telegrams were sent in 1900; 7.25 million in 1920; 4.5 million in 1940; and 7.25 million in 1960.

20 The cable rate to Great Britain from Sydney was £9 9s 6d for 20 words. Traffic increased when charges were reduced in 1902 with the ‘all-red’ route, jointly owned by the British, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand governments. In 1912 a cable was laid between Sydney and Auckland. The Wakapuaka terminal was later abandoned and the cable landed at Titahi Bay near Wellington in 1917. Te Ara Encyclopedia 1966

21 Alexander Graham Bell’s theory of the telephone confirmed by experiment with the first words spoken on 2 June 1875. The first telephone patent, number 174,465, was issued on 7 March, 1876. The first complete sentence was transmitted by telephone in Boston three days later. US Patent Number 174,465, issued on March 3 for ‘Improvements in Telegraphy.’ The first commercial telephone exchange in the world opened at New Haven, Connecticut, 28 January 1878

50 There was still some minor use of Morse code through until the 1950s but by the 1962 centennial of its first use in New Zealand it had been superceded by the teleprinter and the telephone. Teleprinters remained in use, one of their main users being the Press Association with its links to various newspapers around the country and as a network of 300 branch-to-branch circuits leased by businesses and government departments. Their use increased from 1964 with automatic telex switching of teleprinter calls on a national network. Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A.H. McLintock, 1966

This was never the goal of ARPANET, although later work on Internetting did emphasise robustness and survivability, including the ability to withstand losses of large portions of the underlying networks

63 The terms ‘hypertext’ and ‘hyperlink’ were coined by Ted Nelson in 1965 to refer to the structure of a computerised information system through which a user can navigate ‘non sequentially’ or without a pre-structured search path

31 The first international standard packet switching network was developed in the early 1970s and published in 1976 by the CCITT (now ITU). X.25 was designed to become a worldwide public data network similar to the global telephone system for voice, but it never came to pass due to incompatibilities and the lack of interest within the US. It has been used primarily outside the United States for low-speed applications (up to 56kbit/sec) such as credit card verifications, automatic teller machine (ATM) and other financial transactions. X.25 provides a connection-oriented technology for transmission over highly error-prone facilities, which were more common when it was first introduced. Error checking is performed at each node, which can slow overall throughput and renders X.25 incapable of handling real-time voice and video. Source: www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia

2 Bitnet came to mean ‘Because It’s Time Network,’ although the original meaning was ‘Because It’s There Network’

3 At its peak around 1991, Bitnet extended to around 500 organisations and 3,000 nodes within educational institutions. It spanned North America, Europe and some Persian Gulf states but as TCP/IP systems reached maturity and the Internet went mainstream in the early 1990s its popularity rapidly diminished. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BITNET

8 This was upgraded to 1.5Mbit/sec by 1988

9 When the strain of the burgeoning ARPANET began stretching the resources provided voluntarily by the larger UUCP hubs in the United States, Rick Adams, a systems administrator at the Centre for Seismic Studies, began looking at a way for commercial organisations to alleviate the burden. UUNET Communications Services began operation in 1987 as a non-profit corporation providing Usenet feeds, email exchange and access to a large repository of software source code and related information. It shed its non-profit status within two years and changed its name to UUNET Technologies. From 2006 UUNET became an internal brand of Verizon business (formerly MCI).

18 Robert Biddle, formerly of Canterbury University Computer Science Department, in a posting to the nz.general newsgroup, 19 April 1994

19 Biddle chose Cantaur because he expected ‘canterbury’ would one day become a domain name: “Cantuar was also the official abbreviation for the Latin name the Commonwealth Universities Office used for the university, cantuariensis. If you had a BSc from there, you would write J. Bloggs, BSc (Cantuar). A few years later they did away with Latin and made the abbrev ‘cant’ instead. I was disappointed when I got flamed from many places for having a site name that people though was based on centaur spelled wrong.”

20 In Unix and other computer multitasking operating systems, a daemon is a computer program that runs in the background, rather than under the direct control of a user and is usually initiated as a process. The term was coined by the programmers of MIT’s Project MAC and derived from Maxwell’s daemon, an imaginary being from a famous thought experiment that constantly works in the background, sorting molecules. Daemons are also characters in Greek mythology, some of whom handled tasks that the gods couldn’t be bothered with. Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computer_software)

25 On 17 October 1989 a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, collapsing a section of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. Damage was estimated at almost $3 billion in San Francisco, half the total damage figure for the entire earthquake zone. The earthquake knocked out power to San Francisco, and the city was dark for the first time since the 1906 earthquake and fire. Power was fully restored by 20 October. Emergency telephone service became sporadic because a fire broke out in the 911 telephone equipment room. The quake killed 62 people throughout Central California, injured 3757 and left more than 12,000 homeless: www.sfmuseum.net/alm/quakes3.html\#1989

27 Computer programmer Kevin Robert Elz, also known as kre, was a pioneer in connecting Australia to the Internet and more recently was involved in getting Thailand, where he now lives, on line. He helped develop Internet-based research in Australia and operated the .au domain name from 1986 through to the late 1990s and managed the .aus Usenet hierarchy from the 1980s. Some of his achievements include developing a number of important Internet RFC documents, helping connect Australia to the worldwide Internet, developing the Internet-based research network within Australia, and operating the .au domain registry from 1986 through to the late 1990s. He also managed the aus.\* Usenet hierarchy from its inception in the 1980s until the mid-1990s. Amongst undergraduate students within the University of Melbourne Computer Science Department in the mid-1990s, he was considered a semi-mystical figure, having written the BSD operating system’s quota system and contributed to its timezone management system. He was rumoured to have a work contract that allowed him time off whenever cricket was being televised. Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Robert_Elz

31 Ace routers were developed by the DSIR’s Physical Sciences and the Information Technology Group, which became Industrial Research Ltd when the CRIs were formed in 1992. In January 1994 Network Dynamics Ltd acquired the network engineering team of IRL, the Ace Router and all rights from Industrial Research Ltd. It entered a partnership with Securicor 3Net in December 1994, which eventually purchased the company in 1996. In September 1997 Teltrend Inc acquired Securicor 3Net and the New Zealand operation became Teltrend (NZ) Limited. In turn it was acquired by Allied Telesis Japan, and became CentreCOM Systems before reverting to Allied Telesyn Research. The company now has a huge business supplying routers and network equipment worldwide with a 170-strong professional engineering division in Christchurch.

39 In 1984, the ‘father’ of the Freenet movement, Tom Grunder, created St Silicon’s Hospital and Dispensary, a medical bulletin board system that was an asynchronous, interactive messaging system that allowed users to ask a qualified doctor medical questions. This doctor would answer within hours (Archee 1994, p 30). This grew into the Cleveland Free-Net (Morino 1995). Freenet became Grunder’s trademark for the National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN). As of December 1995, NPTN had more than 150 affiliated community systems (NPTN, 1995)

40 A program that searches for file names and resources on the Internet and presents results in hierarchical menus. As users select options, they are moved to different Gopher servers. Where links have been established, Usenet news and other information can be read directly from Gopher.

It was no surprise that seven years after the complaint was made, the telecommunications environment had changed so much that no important precedent was likely to be established.

2 The Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammer of Witches, Witch Hammer, or the Hexenhammer) is the most infamous treatise on prosecuting witches to have come out of the Middle Ages in Europe. It is a comprehensive witch-hunter’s handbook first published in Germany between 1486 and 1487. The 14 editions that arise from the original spread throughout Europe and had a profound impact on witch trials on the Continent for about 200 years. This work is notorious for its vivid misogyny and equating witchcraft with heresy. The Malleus was originally prefaced by the main papal document on witchcraft issued by Pope Innocent VIII on December 5, 1484. It mentions Inquisitors James Sprenger and Heinrich Kramer by name and directs them to combat witchcraft in northern Germany. Source: Wikipedia en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus_Maleficarum

3 Fidonet was founded as a non-commercial network in 1984 by Tom Jennings of San Francisco, California as a means of networking BBS that used his own Fido BBS software. Other BBS software over time was adapted to support his Fidonet protocols and the network became a popular means for hobbyist computer users to communicate. Fidonet has designated co-ordinators at each level to manage the administration of nodes and resolve disputes. Network co-ordinators are responsible for managing the individual nodes within their area. The Fidonet system officially referred only to transfer of netmail, private messages between BBS users. A netmail message would contain the name of the sender and recipient and their Fidonet addresses and the system would route the message from one system to the other until it reached the intended recipient. Netmail allowed for the ‘attachment’ of a single file to every message which led to the automated distribution of files between BBS including games. By far the most commonly-used piggyback protocol was Echomail, which enabled public discussions similar to Usenet newsgroups. Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidonet

7 Tandy Radio Shack’s home computer launched in August 1977 as a direct competitor to the Commodore PET 2001 and the Apple II. Initially the company was unsure how well the machine would sell and kept the initial production run to 3000 units. It sold 10,000 in the first month and 550,000 the first year. The TRS-80 came with cassette input for programs and storage and had to have a special extension to use floppy disks. The motherboard and keyboard were integrated into one unit. The basic unit came with 4k of RAM and later 16k. The processor ran at 1.77MHz. Ref: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80

19 The Telnet (Teletype network) protocol provides a facility for remote log-ins to computers via the Internet, for terminal emulation. A telnet program running on a client can run a log-in session on a remote computer where commands can be read by a telnet server program. It was developed in 1969 and became one of the first Internet standards. A user may telnet remotely to check email or log in into account information and execute operating system commands on that remote computer. Telnet was considered a highly insecure means of accessing remote resources

31 ATM is a cell relay or circuit switching network protocol which encodes traffic into fixed cell sizes or frames rather than packets which are used by Ethernet and IPNetworks. ATM is connection-oriented technology, and establishes a logical link between the two endpoints before the data exchange begins. ATM has proved very successful for wide area networking (WANs) scenario and many carriers have implemented it in their network backbones. However, ATM failed to gain wide use as a local area networking technology, and its complexity has held back its full deployment as the single integrating network technology in the way its inventors intended. For example ATM is increasingly challenged by the converged nature of much modern day network requirements. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode

1 John Lozowsky came from the New York State Archives to work at New Zealand National Archives in the late 1980s at the invitation of former chief archivist Ray Grover. He had worked in New York as an IT consultant for two years and had a vision for computerisation at National Archives, enthusing many with his ideas about the application of IT. He left National Archives in 1991 and moved to the Treasury. He later worked at the Department of Health as the assistant director of IT and was the IT manager at the Ministry of Health in Wellington from January 1996 to April 1999 (associates.ucr.edu/floz704.htm). Lozowsky was contracting for international business consultancy group Marsh & McLennan, in the Twin Towers and had allegedly gone into work early on the morning of the terrorist attack so he could get home early for his son’s birthday.

17 Tangata whenua is used here to broadly describe the descendents of the indigenous people(s) of Aotearoa – it includes groupings such as whanau, hapu, iwi, Maori, etc

18 Kamira says the term ‘principles of the Treaty’ is a softer version of what was in the original Treaty of Waitangi. It was first used in Matiu Rata’s Treaty of Waitangi Bill introduced into the House in November 1974. Rata said its purpose was to provide for the observation and confirmation of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. However Fulbright Scholar Elizabeth Rata says the idea began as a legal reference embedded in law after a meeting in 1986 between Sir Hepi Te Heuheu, paramount chief of Ngati Tuwharetoa, and the deputy prime minister at the time, Sir Geoffrey Palmer. ‘Tribal leaders had been saying the transfer of Crown assets to new state-owned enterprises might infringe Maori rights. Palmer went to see Sir Hepi, who told him Maori concerns would disappear if the new law said: “Nothing in this act shall permit the Crown to act in a manner that is inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.”’ Rata quoted in Ratana Revisited, Newman, Reed, 2006

19 Collective ‘ownership’ of content is the combined knowledge that is held and passed down to generations by whanau and hapu groups, for example. There is usually no legal title or copyright to the knowledge making it particularly vulnerable to misappropriation or exploitation by the commercial sector both in Aotearoa and overseas

20 Kaitiakitanga can be loosely defined as inter-generational guardianship

46 Ken Keyes Jnr, The One Hundredth Monkey

47 Paraphrased by Keith Newman from Watson’s book Lifetide. Curiously Takasakiyama (Mount Takasaki) is a forested mountain just outside of Beppu, home to more than 1500 wild Japanese monkeys. The monkeys are fed regularly by park wardens in order to keep them on the mountain and prevent conflicts with farmers and residents in the neighbourhood

70 In 1992 Gordon Cook founded the Cook report, the first newsletter focused on the development of the commercial Internet. He continues to explore ways to show local communities, policy makers and enterprises the value of broadband Internet as a locally owned and controlled infrastructure for collaboration, innovation and business and economic development and innovative use of the Internet for business and economic development. It is a critical enabler of business activity through real time collaboration among geographically-dispersed entrepreneurs and critical for the creation of value creation, talent building in the relationship economy, gordoncook.net

73 References to “The future’s already arrived. It’s just not evenly distributed yet” go back to Usenet in early 1996 and there are several variants of the quote: “The Future is already here (It is just not uniformly distributed)” on a blog called Whuffle, which aligned with Time magazine writer Bill Buxton allegedly stealing a line from Gibson on 3 October 2004 and further references to the quote, with attribution to William Gibson, that appear in 2001 and 2002, including one book, Reinventing Strategy, published also on 12 April 2002. Another source Free, Perfect, and Now: A CEO’s True Story by Robert Rodin with Curtis Hartman, in February 1999 which says “the future can be hard to recognise. It’s not evenly distributed; it’s hidden in corners.” The question arises, did William Gibson read this book? Did Rodin read Gibson somewhere?
