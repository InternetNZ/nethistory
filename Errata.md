This wiki does not yet include some of the quoted excerpts or any of the photographs.

Chapter 7
---------

In the printed edition there are two placing of footnote <sup>1</sup>, the second of which, and all subsequent footnotes, are out by one in the footnotes text. So footnote <sup>2</sup> in the body text refers to footnote <sup>3</sup> in the footnote text. This has been corrected for this wiki.

Chapter 16
----------

In the printed edition the sidebar 'Exploiting the vulnerable' appears, but does not feature in this Wiki.
